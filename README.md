# logo-generator![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)
  ## Description
  This was built using a Node.js command-line application, that provides the user with questions such as, what colour, shape and three characters would the user like on the logo. When the user has chosen what they would like their logo to look like, a SVG file is created named ‘logo.svg’ for the user to access. This file can be opened in the browser. This application has default choices in place for the shape and colour if the user does not put anything in the command-line. This application was built using Node.js.
